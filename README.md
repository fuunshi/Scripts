# Scripts Repository

Welcome to my Scripts repository! This repository is where I share various scripts that I write in my free time. From automation to utility scripts, you'll find a variety of projects here. Feel free to explore and use them as needed.

## Projects

### PDF Fusion Wizard

PDF Fusion Wizard is a Python script that allows you to merge multiple PDF files into a single PDF document. Whether you have several PDF documents scattered across your computer or you need to combine different sections of a report, this script makes the process simple and efficient.

### Youtube Downloader (yt-dlp)

The Youtube Downloader script, built using bash and yt-dlp, enables you to download bulk videos or music from YouTube and other supported platforms. Whether you want to create a playlist for offline viewing or extract audio files from videos, this script provides a convenient solution.

Let's keep coding and exploring new possibilities together!
